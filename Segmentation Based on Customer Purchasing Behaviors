📘 Overview

This project applies multiple unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
By comparing algorithms such as K-Means, PAM, CLARA, and Hierarchical Clustering, the goal is to determine which method best captures natural customer groupings for actionable business insights.

🎯 Objectives

Explore the clusterability of customer purchasing data

Compare clustering algorithms (K-Means, PAM, CLARA, Hierarchical)

Evaluate models using silhouette scores and cluster interpretability

Identify the most meaningful and stable customer segments

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle – Customer Purchasing Behaviors
, which includes customer-level attributes such as:

Variable	Description
Budget	Monthly spending budget
Frequency	Number of purchases
Demographics	Customer demographic data
Income	Annual income
Loyalty	Loyalty score

⚙️ Methodology
🔹 1. Data Preparation

Imported and cleaned customer data (Customer Purchasing Behaviors.csv)

Scaled all numeric variables for consistent distance calculations

Conducted correlation analysis to understand feature relationships

Key Observations:

High correlation (≥ 0.97) between variables like purchase frequency, income, and loyalty

Customers with higher income tend to spend and shop more frequently

All features are interrelated, suggesting no independent variables

🔹 2. Prediagnostics

Hopkins Statistic = 0.9358, indicating strong clustering tendency

Determined the optimal number of clusters using silhouette scores across algorithms:

K-Means → ~9 clusters

PAM → 6 clusters

CLARA → 5 clusters

Hierarchical → 5 clusters

🔹 3. Algorithms Compared
🟦 K-Means

Tested with Euclidean and Pearson distance metrics

Euclidean: more distinct separation, avg silhouette = 0.56

Pearson: more overlap, avg silhouette = 0.63

🟩 PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids)

Optimal clusters = 6

Clear separation, robust against outliers

Performs better than K-Means for overlapping clusters

🟧 CLARA (Clustering Large Applications)

Extension of PAM for large datasets

Merged similar clusters to improve cohesion

Best silhouette score = 0.64

🟪 Hierarchical Clustering

Built dendrogram using complete linkage

Achieved high-quality separation (Q ≈ 1)

Provides interpretability of relationships between clusters

Slightly lower silhouette = 0.61

📈 Results Summary
Algorithm	Optimal k	Silhouette Score	Remarks
K-Means	9	0.56–0.63	Clear but overlapping clusters
PAM	6	0.63	Balanced and distinct clusters
CLARA	5	0.64	Best performance overall
Hierarchical	5	0.61	Good structure, useful hierarchy

Conclusion:

The best-performing algorithms are CLARA and PAM, both achieving high silhouette scores and strong cluster cohesion.
Hierarchical clustering, though slightly lower in score, provides valuable insights into inter-cluster relationships.
